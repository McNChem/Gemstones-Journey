# Gemstones-Journey
Gemstones Journey is what I am updating as I learn to code. 
Please do not close the branch with original HTML. It will be used to show contrast between 1st HTML attempt to current coding level.

I would love feedback as I continue to move forward. I am going slowly as I figuring out where each piece fits where. 

Thanks!

Please let me know if you have questions, feedback, or comments!

			<p> A lone black cat with a twinkle in her eye, started on her journey. Dazed and confused, she ran on the wet path, annoyed by the
			droplets hitting her fur. She was in unfamilar terrority and her human was nowhere in sight.</p>
			
			<p>All she remembered was the horrible screeching, smell of fire, burning oil, and twisted metal.</p>
